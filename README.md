# WuWa-Database

A database of wuthering waves version 1.1. It includes characters and weapons, and is set up to look like a store where you can outright buy what/who you want.
The app is based on node & express using pug as the view engine, and mongodb to handle database stuff. This database won't be updated, as this was just a fun project in learning how to use node, express, pug and mongodb.
